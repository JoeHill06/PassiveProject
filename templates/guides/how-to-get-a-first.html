<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Understanding What You Need</h2>
    <p>A First Class degree means achieving an overall average of 70% or above across your final years. Here's what that typically requires:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Consistently high marks (65%+ minimum in most modules)</li>
        <li>Excellent performance in high-credit modules (especially dissertation)</li>
        <li>Strong understanding of core concepts</li>
        <li>Ability to think critically and analytically</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <h3>Reality Check</h3>
        <p>You don't need 70%+ in every single module to get a First overall. If some modules are worth more credits or weighted more heavily, focus extra effort there. Use our <a href="{{ url_for('degree_calculator') }}">Degree Classification Calculator</a> to see exactly what you need.</p>

    <h2>Academic Strategies</h2>

    <h3>1. Master the Basics Early</h3>
    <p>Build a strong foundation from the start:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't skip Year 1 even though it doesn't count - it builds essential knowledge</li>
        <li>Thoroughly understand core concepts before moving to advanced topics</li>
        <li>Address gaps in knowledge immediately, don't let them accumulate</li>
        <li>Seek help from lecturers or tutors when concepts are unclear</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Engage Deeply with Material</h3>
    <p>First-class work shows deep understanding, not just memorization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read widely:</strong> Go beyond required readings to academic journals and books</li>
        <li><strong>Think critically:</strong> Question assumptions, compare different viewpoints</li>
        <li><strong>Make connections:</strong> Link concepts across different modules</li>
        <li><strong>Apply knowledge:</strong> Use real-world examples and case studies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Understand Assessment Criteria</h3>
    <p>Know exactly what markers are looking for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read marking schemes and rubrics carefully</li>
        <li>Look at past first-class essays and exam answers (if available)</li>
        <li>Understand the difference between 60% and 70% work</li>
        <li>Ask for feedback on drafts before submission</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Study Techniques</h2>

    <h3>Active Learning Methods</h3>
    <p>These techniques are proven to improve understanding and retention:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Recall:</strong> Test yourself regularly without looking at notes</li>
        <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Review material at increasing intervals</li>
        <li><strong>Feynman Technique:</strong> Explain concepts in simple terms</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Problems:</strong> Solve problems without solutions first</li>
        <li><strong>Teaching Others:</strong> Explain concepts to study groups or friends</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Effective Note-Taking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't just copy slides - add your own understanding and connections</li>
        <li>Use Cornell method, mind maps, or whatever works for you</li>
        <li>Review and reorganize notes within 24 hours of lectures</li>
        <li>Create summary sheets for quick revision</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reading Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Skim first to get overview, then read in detail</li>
        <li>Take notes as you read (don't just highlight)</li>
        <li>Focus on understanding arguments, not memorizing facts</li>
        <li>Keep a reading log with key points from each source</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Time Management</h2>

    <h3>Plan Your Time Wisely</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start early:</strong> Begin assignments as soon as they're set</li>
        <li><strong>Break down tasks:</strong> Large assignments into manageable chunks</li>
        <li><strong>Use a calendar:</strong> Mark all deadlines and work backwards</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Focus most effort on high-credit, heavily-weighted modules</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weekly Study Schedule</h3>
    <p>A sustainable study routine for a First:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attend all lectures and seminars (non-negotiable)</li>
        <li>Review notes within 24 hours of each class</li>
        <li>2-3 hours of focused study per lecture hour</li>
        <li>Regular reading beyond required materials</li>
        <li>Weekly review of all subjects to maintain knowledge</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
        <p>4 hours of focused, distraction-free study is worth more than 8 hours of unfocused work. Take regular breaks, eliminate distractions, and study when you're most alert.</p>
