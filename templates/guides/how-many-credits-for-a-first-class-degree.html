<h1>How Many Credits Do You Need for a First Class Degree?</h1>
<p>A First Class degree is not about accumulating a specific number of credits &mdash; it is about your average mark across those credits. This guide explains how the UK credit system works and how credits relate to achieving a First.</p>

{% include 'includes/ad-vertical.html' %}

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>The Short Answer</h2>
    <p>You need to <strong>pass all required credits</strong> for your programme (typically 360 credits over three years) <strong>and</strong> achieve an overall credit-weighted average of <strong>70% or above</strong> across the years that count towards your classification.</p>
    <p>It is not about getting 70% in a certain number of credits. It is about your weighted average across all credits being 70% or higher.</p>

    <h2>How UK Credits Work</h2>
    <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Year</th><th>Credits Per Year</th><th>Cumulative Total</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Level 4</td><td>Year 1</td><td>120</td><td>120</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Level 5</td><td>Year 2</td><td>120</td><td>240</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Level 6</td><td>Year 3</td><td>120</td><td>360</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>A standard UK undergraduate degree requires 360 credits. Each year consists of 120 credits, split across modules of varying sizes (typically 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 credits each).</p>

    <h3>Scottish Degrees</h3>
    <p>Scottish Honours degrees are four years (480 credits total, 120 per year). The classification calculation typically focuses on years 3 and 4 (Levels 9 and 10 in the Scottish system).</p>

    <h2>Credits and Classification: The Key Point</h2>
    <p>Your degree classification is based on a <strong>credit-weighted average</strong>, not on the number of credits at a particular mark. Here is how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each module mark is multiplied by its credit value.</li>
        <li>These are summed and divided by the total credits to give a year average.</li>
        <li>Year averages are then weighted (e.g. 40% Year 2, 60% Year 3).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Two students both take 120 credits in Year 3:</p>
    <table>
        <thead><tr><th></th><th>Student A</th><th>Student B</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Module 1 (40 credits)</td><td>75%</td><td>82%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Module 2 (30 credits)</td><td>72%</td><td>65%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Module 3 (30 credits)</td><td>68%</td><td>60%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Module 4 (20 credits)</td><td>70%</td><td>72%</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Year Average</strong></td><td><strong>71.5%</strong></td><td><strong>71.2%</strong></td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Both students achieve a First-class year average, but through different mark profiles. Student A is consistent; Student B is high in the largest module. The credit weighting means the 40-credit module has the most influence.</p>

    <h2>Do All Credits Count?</h2>
    <p>At most UK universities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Year 1 credits (Level 4):</strong> You must pass them, but they usually do not count towards your classification.</li>
        <li><strong>Year 2 credits (Level 5):</strong> Typically count 25-40% towards your classification.</li>
        <li><strong>Year 3 credits (Level 6):</strong> Typically count 60-75% towards your classification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This means the 120 credits you take in your final year usually have the biggest impact on whether you get a First.</p>

    <h2>How Many Credits at 70%+ Do I Need?</h2>
    <p>This is a common question, but there is no fixed answer. You do not need all credits at 70%. You need your <em>average</em> to be 70%. Some marks can be below 70% if others are above &mdash; they balance out.</p>
    <p>However, some universities use a "profile" rule for borderline cases. For example, if your average is 68-69%, you might be awarded a First if more than 50% of your final-year credits are at 70%+. This varies by university.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need 70% in every module to get a First?</h3>
            <p>No. You need an overall credit-weighted average of 70% or above. You can score below 70% in some modules as long as your higher marks in other modules bring the average up to 70% or more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does a high-credit module matter more?</h3>
            <p>Yes. A 40-credit module has twice the influence of a 20-credit module on your year average. Performing well in high-credit modules (like dissertations) is an effective strategy for raising your overall average.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the minimum number of credits for a degree?</h3>
            <p>A standard UK undergraduate honours degree requires 360 credits (120 per year for three years). You must pass all required credits to graduate. Some universities allow compensation for minor failures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I get a First with a low Year 2 mark?</h3>
            <p>Possibly, depending on the year weighting. If Year 3 counts for 60-67%, strong final-year performance can overcome a weaker Year 2. Use our <a href="{{ url_for('final_year_marks') }}">Final Year Marks Calculator</a> to check what you'd need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do ECTS credits compare to UK credits?</h3>
            <p>UK credits use a different scale from European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits. Generally, 1 ECTS credit = 2 UK credits. A UK year of 120 credits equals 60 ECTS credits. A full UK degree (360 credits) equals 180 ECTS credits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if I fail some credits?</h3>
            <p>Failed modules usually need to be retaken. Retake marks are typically capped at the pass threshold (40%). Capped marks are used in your overall average, making it harder to reach 70%. Some universities allow compensation for marginal failures (e.g. 35-39%) if your overall profile is strong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the dissertation count for more credits?</h3>
            <p>Dissertations are typically 30-40 credits (sometimes 60), making them one of the largest single modules. Because of credit weighting, your dissertation mark significantly influences your final-year average. Scoring well on your dissertation is one of the most impactful things you can do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What about placement years?</h3>
            <p>Sandwich year placements usually carry 120 credits but are typically assessed as pass/fail and do not count towards your classification. You graduate with "with industrial experience" or similar notation. The placement year does not affect your percentage average.</p>
